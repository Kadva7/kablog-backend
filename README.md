## Lemon

A PHP framework that is just bitter sweet 🍋. I don't know any PHP, thus this will be a test of my own hatred towards myself.

## Instalation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Lemon-Framework/app  
make
```

## License

Since this is a fork of [Lemon framework skeleton](https://github.com/Lemon-Framework/app) any code that existed before the fork is left under the same license.
